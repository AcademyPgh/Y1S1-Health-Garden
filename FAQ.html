    <h1 class="title">Welcome to Zen Garden</h1>
    <h3 class="initial" id="0">Ready to Begin?</h3>
    <div id="1"> Before you do anything, you should pick where you want to put your house.<span><img src="./assets/house.png"></span>
      <br>Click on the browser window that has your garden and drag your house onto a tile.<span><img src="./assets/un_terraformed_dirt.png"></span>
    </div>
    <div id="2"> There are a few rules for planting plants.
      <p class="list">
        <ul>
          <li>You must prepare the dirt by shoveling<span><img src="./assets/spade.png"></span>before you can plant.</li>
          <li>You can only water<span><img src="./assets/waterCan.png"></span>or fertilize<span><img src="./assets/fertilizer_bag.png"></span> a plant. Doing so to plain dirt would just be wasteful!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      Go back to your garden and drag the shovel<span><img src="./assets/spade.png"></span>onto a patch of dirt <span><img src="./assets/un_terraformed_dirt.png"></span> , then drag an unlocked plant<span><img src="./assets/tulip_icon.png"></span> onto the newly prepared dirt <span><img src="./assets/terraformed_dirt.png"></span>.
    </div>

    <div id="3"> Now you have a baby plant in the ground and ready to be cared for.
      Watering your plant will help it grow to the next stage<span><img src="./assets/waterCan.png"></span>.<br>
      You can use fertilizer<span><img src="./assets/fertilizer_bag.png"></span>to help your plant grow quickly, but fertilizer will cost you energy.
    </div>

    <div id="4"> If you were paying attention to your energy, you would have seen that your energy has decreased.
      <ul>
        <li>Placing your house<span><img src="./assets/house.png"></span></li>
        <li>Preparing dirt<span><img src="./assets/spade.png"></span></li>
        <li>Planting a plant<span><img src="./assets/tulip_icon.png"></span></li>
        <li>Pertilizing a plant<span><img src="./assets/fertilizer_bag.png"></span></li>
        <li>Harvesting a plant<span><img src="./assets/glove.png"></span></li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong>All of the above will all take energy to do.</strong></h4>

      Your energy will slowly refill as time goes by, so don’t worry if you run out.
      Water<span><img src="./assets/waterCan.png"></span>is free so you can water your plants whenever you want to!
    </div>

    <div id="5">
      You might notice as you play that your plants aren’t growing.
      To grow your plant to the next stage you must water<span><img src="./assets/waterCan.png"></span> and fertilize<span><img src="./assets/fertilizer_bag.png"></span>it enough and then you need to sign out of the game and come back to see the plant grow.
      We hope that you’ll enjoy the game, but we don’t want you to spend all day in your beautiful virtual garden.
      So take some breaks and maybe you’ll see the next level of plant when you come back!
    </div>

    <div id="6">
      Once you do get a plant all the way to it’s final stage you can harvest<span><img src="./assets/glove.png"></span>the plant for sunshine!
      To harvest, just drag the gardening glove<span><img src="./assets/glove.png"></span>down to the fully grown plant.
      You can’t harvest any plants but the fully grown ones. Have patience, they’ll make it!
      Also, don’t be too quick to harvest your plants.
      There may be some cool effects that will show up from time to time on fully grown plants.
      You don’t want to miss those!
    </div>

    <div id="7">If you have a plant you want to remove, but it’s not at it’s final stage, just use the shovel<span><img src="./assets/spade.png"></span> and prepare the dirt again.
      Be careful! You won’t get any sunshine for this.
    </div>

    <div id="8">Using sunshine, you can unlock new plants to plant in your garden.
      Just click on the plant you would like to unlock<span><img src="./assets/rose_icon_locked.png"></span>.
      If you have enough sunshine the plant will become available.
    </div>

    <div id="9">There are even better ways of refilling your energy or getting more sunshine.
      If you click on your house<span><img src="./assets/house.png"></span>, you can add to your to-do list.
      You can fill it with anything you want.
      Perhaps you need to do laundry, remember to thank someone, or even remember to come back to the Zen Garden game tomorrow.
      You can easily add them all to you To-Do List.
    </div>

    <div id="10">Once you finish a task on the list, you can click the check mark to complete you task.
      You’ll notice that it will also restore some of your energy!
      If you need to remove an item on the list, you can click the X next to the item to remove it.
      Once you’re finished with your To-Do list, just click the X in the upper right of that window and you’ll be back in your garden.
    </div>

    <div id="11">To increase your sunshine, you just need to fill out a journal entry.
      Click on the journal <span><img src="./assets/journal.png"></span> in the toolbar. This will bring up the journal window.
      Simply write down your thoughts and anything else you need to in the box, and then use the sliders to describe your emotions.
      Then you just hit submit. Once you have submitted, you can click the X in the upper right of that window to go back to your garden.
      Now you have more sunshine as well!
    </div>
    <div id="12">
      Now go out and tend to your garden!
